## Title
Automotive Efficiency Evolution: A Drill-Down Narrative Visualization

## Caption
This interactive narrative visualization explores the evolution of automotive efficiency and performance across manufacturers, time periods, and regions. Using a drill-down story structure, the visualization reveals the fundamental trade-offs between fuel economy and engine power that have shaped the automotive industry. The narrative begins with an overview of horsepower vs. MPG relationships, then progressively allows deeper exploration into manufacturer priorities, historical trends during key periods like the 1973-74 oil crisis, regional differences in efficiency approaches, and detailed user-controlled exploration. Built with D3.js, the visualization employs consistent color schemes, multiple annotation templates, and comprehensive parameter systems to guide users through the automotive efficiency story while maintaining visual coherence across five interconnected scenes.
